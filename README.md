## Instructions
To run the application you can:
1. [Clone](https://github.com/JoBrigden/restaurantreviewapp) this repository
  * Start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

  * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

  * With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000.

2. Visit [here](https://JoBrigden.github.io/restaurantreviewsapp/) to access the site immediately.
